# Introduction
Welcome to my software engineering portfolio GitHub repo! My name is [your name], and I'm a backend engineer with [number of years] of experience in the industry. As a passionate developer, I have created several projects that I am proud of and wanted to showcase them in one place.

# About the Portfolio Website
As a backend engineer, I am more interested in the functionality and performance of the projects I work on. However, I realize the importance of having a portfolio website to showcase my work to potential employers and clients. Therefore, I decided to create a portfolio website that highlights some of the backend-related projects I've worked on.

Please note that I am not a UX designer or front-end expert. However, I tried my best to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website. I understand that there might be visual discrepancies or best practices that I have not considered. If you do find anything that could be improved, feel free to drop me a message using the contact box at the bottom of the site.

# Technology Used
The portfolio website was built using the following technologies:

React: I chose React because it's a popular and powerful front-end framework that allows me to create reusable components and efficiently manage the state of the application.
JavaScript: I used JavaScript for both the front-end and back-end logic of the application.
CSS: I used CSS to style the website and make it more visually appealing.
HTML: I used HTML to create the structure and layout of the website.
EmailJS: I used EmailJS to handle the contact form on the website. It allows users to send me a message without revealing my email address.
