# Software Engineer Portfolio 2.0
As primarily a backend engineer, I wanted a place to showcase the projects that Iâ€™ve created. After my initial attempt at using React for a portfolio website, I pursued a second version; building on my knowledge previously obtained through the first version and online tutorials.

A few things to note are that I in no way am a UX designer or front-end expert. This website has been created to enable me to showcase some of my more backend-related projects with that being said there might be visual discrepancies or best practices that I have not considered. If you do find anything that could be improved feel free to drop me a message using the contact box at the bottom of the site.
